# Ralph - A package manager for C++

Features:

* Install and remove packages
* Package groups
* Metadata stored as plain JSON and distributed using a plain git repository
* Project support
* Cross-platform
* Pre-built binaries and from-source installations
* Per-project databases

This project is still in early development and is not production ready.

## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/02JanDal/ralph.git
    $ cd ralph
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ cmake --build .

## Usage

Start by simply running the executable without any arguments and you'll get a list of all available commands:

    $ ralph
    ralph 0.1
    ...

If you want more information about a specific command you can either use the help flag or the help command:

    $ ralph package install --help
    ...
    $ ralph help package install
    ...

Some commands to get you started:

    $ ralph sources add official https://github.com/02JanDal/ralph-packages.git
    ...
    $ ralph search json
    ...
    RapidJSON
    ...
    $ ralph install rapidjson
    ...

This adds the official repository of packages to the default database (usually the user database), searches for and installs a JSON library.

    $ ralph project new myproject

Which creates a new project with a ralph metaadata file that can be used for dependency management.

## Alternatives

C++ has gone from not having a single to having way to many package/dependency managers. And this is yet another one. Other options I am aware of:

* [conan.io](https://conan.io/)
* [CPM](https://github.com/iauns/cpm)
* [Hunter](https://github.com/ruslo/hunter)
* [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/)

Apart from [NIH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) this project also fixes some shortcomings with these existing solutions, like not being cross-platform (NuGet), only source packages (CPM, Hunter), being tied to a specific build system (CPM, Hunter), or having a horrible codebase (conan.io) (if mine is better or not is debatable).

Additionally this project includes some features inspired by other package managers like package groups (gemsets from RVM), per-project databases (bundler) and distribution using git repositories (homebrew) that can not be found in the above.

## Contributing

Normal GitHub procedure:

1. Fork on Github
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Edit code (preferably in a branch)
4. Commit and push your changes
5. Open a PR (pull request) on Github

Try to keep the same coding style as used in the rest of the project.
